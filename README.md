# Comparison of Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine for Predicting Jakarta Air Quality Index 
## Overview
The city of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, has long grappled with air pollution, posing significant health risks to its residents. In an effort to address this concern, this research aims to leverage classification algorithms for data mining, specifically focusing on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Jakarta. By utilizing datasets sourced from the Jakarta Open Data Website, we concentrate on understanding and forecasting air quality conditions. This README provides an overview of the project, highlighting the use of Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the primary models.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this research is to predict forthcoming air quality levels in different regions of Jakarta. The focus is on utilizing machine learning models to analyze historical data and make accurate predictions regarding AQI. The goal is to contribute valuable insights that can aid in implementing effective measures to improve air quality in the city.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this research is sourced from the Jakarta Open Data Website, containing relevant information about various environmental parameters, pollution levels, and historical AQI values. The dataset is meticulously processed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring its suitability for training and evaluating the models.

## Methods
Classification Algorithms
Two prominent machine learning algorithms, Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are employed to build predictive models for AQI. These algorithms are chosen for their effectiveness in handling complex datasets and their potential to reveal patterns in air quality variations.

## Model Evaluation
Grid search Cross-Validation (Grid search CV) is employed to fine-tune the models and identify optimal parameters. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of the models in predicting AQI. The final model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 91.45%.

## Conclusion
This research serves as a valuable exploration into the application of Decision Trees and SVM for predicting the Air Quality Index in Jakarta. The findings, based on the dataset from Jakarta Open Data Website, demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in making accurate predictions. The high accuracy attained through Grid search CV highlights the robustness of the chosen approach.
